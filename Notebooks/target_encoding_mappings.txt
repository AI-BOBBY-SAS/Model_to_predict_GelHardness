=== TARGET ENCODING DETAILS ===
Target column used: 'Hardness/firmness/strength (g)'

ðŸ”¹ Explanation:
For each unique value in a categorical column, we replace it with the average
of the target values associated with that category in the dataset.
This is known as Target Encoding.

ðŸ”¸ Formula :
Encoded value = Average of the target ('Hardness/firmness/strength (g)')
for all rows where the category appears.
Example: if 'Country = France' â†’ take the average hardness for all rows where Country = France.
